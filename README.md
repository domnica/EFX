# EFX
Algorithm for finding EFX allocations

The paper that describes the algorithm is in EFX_paper.zip. The implementation of the algorithm can be found in Local-search-for-EFX.ipynb. The program generates a random instance of valuations and finds an EFX allocation for that instance. 

To visualize the runtime of the algorithm for n=15 agents and growing number of items (from m = 3 to m = 1050), run the accompanying notebook EFX-visualizations-15-agents.ipynb. Similarly, to visualize the runtime for m = 10,000 items and growing number of agents (from n = 4 to n = 100), run the notebook EFX_visualizations_10k_items.ipynb.
