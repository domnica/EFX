# EFX
The algorithm for finding EFX allocations is described in the paper (EFX_paper.zip). 
- The implementation can be found in Local-search-for-EFX.ipynb. The program generates a random instance of valuations and finds an EFX allocation for that instance. 

- To visualize the runtime of the algorithm for n=15 agents and growing number of items (from m = 3 to m = 1050), run the accompanying notebook EFX-visualizations-15-agents.ipynb.
- To visualize the runtime for m = 10,000 items and growing number of agents (from n = 4 to n = 100), run the notebook EFX_visualizations_10k_items.ipynb.
