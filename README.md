# EFX
Algorithms for finding EFX allocations

The implementation of the EFX allocation finder can be found in Local-search-for-EFX.ipynb. The program generates a random instance of valuations and finds an EFX allocation for that instance. 

To visualize the runtime of the algorithm for n=15 agents and growing number of items (from 3 to 1050), run the accompanying notebook EFX-visualizations-15-agents.ipynb.
