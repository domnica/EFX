# EFX
Algorithms for finding EFX allocations

The implementation for the EFX allocation finder is in the file Local-search-for-EFX.ipynb. The program generates a random instance of valuations and finds an EFX allocation for that instance. 
The file Visualizations-15-agents.ipynb contains the data and program used in the paper to generate the images for 15 agents number of items growing from 3 to 1050.
